# cringe2poop

## If you're cringing, then you're pooping your pants!

### Description
Lately, some form of the word "cringe" is used to describe even the most mundane
events and actions, especially at places like reddit. I find the comments much
more interesting if pants are being pooped.

If you'd like improve the regex or the text replacement, I'm happy to accept 
pull requests. I just wanted to get this done so I could have a more pleasant and
less "cringe-y" reddit experience.

### Installation
Go to chrome://extensions , load the crx, enjoy.

### License
It's all yours.
