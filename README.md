# cringe2poop Chrome Extension

## Make every cringe a pants-pooping!

### Description
Lately, some form of the word "cringe" is used to describe people's response to 
even the most mundane events and actions, especially at places like reddit. I find 
the comments much more interesting if pants are being pooped.

- "I was cringing so hard" becomes "I was pooping so hard"
- "His pants were so cringe-worthy" becomes "His pants were so poop-my-pants-inducing"
- ...and many more witty replacements! (actually, not really many)

If you'd like improve the regex or the text replacement, I'm happy to accept 
pull requests. I just wanted to get this done so I could have a more pleasant and
less "cringe-y" reddit experience.

### Installation
Go to [your Chrome extensions page](chrome://extensions), load the crx (you may need to enable developer mode), and enjoy.

### License
It's all yours.
